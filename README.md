# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
I have used a SONAR data of Kaggle to predict whether the object is a Mine or a Rock.

Consider there is a war going, A submarines wants to go in enemy territory so it should be aware of the mines beneath it. But similarly there are rocks as well, so how could it predict wehther the object is a mine or a rock?
Submarine uses SONAR which sends sound signals. This received Signal is then processed and detected whther the object is mine or a rock.   

Technologies : Google colab, Python 

Workflow : We need to collect SONAR Data. After that we need to pre-process the data. Then we have to split the data into Train test split model. After that we feed this data to our ML model.Here we are going to use Logistic Regression Model which is a Supervised Learning Algorithm.Once we train our data with the LRM we get the Trained LRM.
